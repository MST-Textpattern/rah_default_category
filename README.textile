p. Rah_default_category is a tiny admin-extension for "Textpattern CMS":http://www.textpattern.com. The plugin brings the default section feature to categories. The extension adds new options to Textpattern's "Advanced Preferences":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Advanced_Preferences that allow site admins can set default article categories, just like one can select a default article section. Selected default categories are then used as the default option on the "Write":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Write panel. The plugin is an answer to a feature request made by "jim":http://forum.textpattern.com/viewtopic.php?id=29148.
